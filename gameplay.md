Thoughts on gameplay.

The player has missions for each level. Maybe they need to fix someone's computer.

Each level is a new office building. They're working their way up to the CEO, who knows nothing about what they do.

Level 1 is the basement.
Level 2 ...

There's a timer on completing the missions for each level. They must be completed in order. The current mission is displayed in text at the bottom of the screen. Maybe with a pointer that tells you where you need to go.

Mission types:
* Diagnose an issue. Could require a new part from the supply closet that you have to go retrieve and bring back. You can just turn it off and back on again. That uses time, but has a random chance of just fixing it.
* Retrieve a part from the supply closet on the current floor. Bring it to a computer.

Controls:
* left, right are movement
* trigger button is jump
* up brings up a menu of things you can do when you're interacting with an object
* down creates a distraction, but you can't be moving when you click down.

Enemies:
* Karens that try to distract you when you are doing your mission. If they catch you, they talk to you for a bit and you can't escape. Takes time. They say inane things to you, which you can read at the bottom. You can avoid them by not touching them. Or you can create a distraction. There's a hit window left or right of the Karen. If you enter that while moving, you're stuck talking to them.
* Broken printers are another type of enemy. They may appear while you're on a mission and you have to go fix it.

Distractions:
* You create a distraction by pressing the down button on the controller, but they only work while you're not moving. And they only work if you do it within a short range of the Karen, but not touching. So you need to get good at sprinting and stopping and pressing down. And if you move before the distraction is complete, it doesn't work.
* Randomized responses
* If you do a distraction while the Karen is near but not touching you, then they'll freeze. Just have them turn grey-ish. Or maybe they disappear into a bush like the Homer meme.
* One type of distraction makes you change clothes and look like an executive.
* Another type of distraction makes you say something uncomfortable. Show the text at the bottom.
* Another type of distraction shows a body odor around you. It's green. The Karen says "ew" or something like that.

Karen quotes:
* "How about that weather"
* 

Uncomfotable quotes:
* ""


New thoughts:
* Make jumping higher, allow to jump over enemies
* You can slide by enemies, too
* You have missions, like replacing cartridges in printers
* Missions show up as tickets in the bottom of the screen.
  * They have an indicator like an "urgent" or "warning" sign, with an icon.
    The icon is a thing like a printer, or a power symbol, etc.
    Next to those is an indicator telling you which printer it is and the direction to it.
  * Each level has a certain number of tickets you have to accomplish. Getting them done
    allows you to face the final boss.
* Your goal is to get the missions done as fast as possible.
* Bad guys
  * Mice
  * Fires to be put out, have to grab the fire extinguisher.
